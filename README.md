Raspberry Jam Mod - a Mod Forge Minecraft 1.8+ mod implementing most of Raspberry Juice/Pi API

To install for single-player and LAN use (as well as for client-side use with a server):
 1. Set up a Minecraft profile of the correct Minecraft version and run it once.
 2. Install the lastest version of Minecraft Forge for your precise Minecraft version (http://files.minecraftforge.net/)
 3. Put the contents of mods.zip in your .minecraft/mods folder (there will be a number of 
    subfolders like 1.8, 1.8.9, etc.--they should all go there).
 4. Put the sample scripts in in your .minecraft/mcpipy directory.
 5. Install Python if you need to.
On Windows, steps 3-5 can be automated by using the .exe installer.

To install on a server:
 1. Download a Forge installer from http://files.minecraftforge.net/
 2. Run and it point it to a directory where you want your server to be, select "Server", 
    and it will download and install a Minecraft server.
 3. Create a mods/ folder in the server directory and put RaspberryJamMod.jar for your
    server version there.
 4. Put some sample scripts in a mcpipy/ subdirectory of the same folder as your minecraft server.
    Make sure to include all mcpipy/mcpi. 
 5. Make a passwords.dat file if your server is open outside your LAN. (Documentation TODO.)
 6. Instead of running minecraft_server_X.Y.jar to start the server, run the forge jar.
